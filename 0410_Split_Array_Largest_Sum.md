### 410. Split Array Largest Sum
Hard

Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.

Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
Output: 18

Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2
Output: 9
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,4,4], m = 3
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
1 <= m <= min(50, nums.length)
```

            We guess the answer is in the middle of those two values.
            
            To verify the guess is correct, we do this:
            - break up the array so that each subarray is at most the middle value
            - if the count of those subarrays is less than m, then it is too high
            - if the count of those subarrays is more than m, then it is too low
            
            Ok we found an answer where we matched m, set that as the new high
            and see if we can go lower.
