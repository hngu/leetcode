### 542. 01 Matrix
Medium

Given an m x n binary matrix mat, return the distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.

The distance between two adjacent cells is 1. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]
```

**Constraints:**
```
m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 104
1 <= m * n <= 104
mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
There is at least one 0 in mat.
```

### Solution

    def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        """
            NOTE: this can be solved using 2 pass dynamic programming -
            1st pass: Scan the matrix and look only the left and above neighboring cells min(left/up direction, currentMin)
            2nd pass: Scan the matrix and look only the right and below neighboring cells min(right/below direction, currentMin)
            Two passes are required because in the 1st pass, the cells below and right are not yet computed.
            Anyway, I didn't use this approach.

            If you are a zero, then distance to nearest zero is zero.
            So we only care about the 1s.
            
            Create a result table to store nearest zero for lookup[i][j]
            It will be initialized where all zeroes will be zero.
            
            Then iterate through mat and for each 1:
            - Check if I have any zeroes near me. If I do, then set result[i][j] = 1
            - Else, get the min of the nearest zero distance from my neighbors
            - and add + 1 to the result table
            
            Return result table
