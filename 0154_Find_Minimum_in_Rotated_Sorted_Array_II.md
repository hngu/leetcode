### 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
Hard

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
``` 

Follow up: This problem is similar to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        first = 0
        length = len(nums)
        last = length - 1
        
        while first <= last:
            first_num = nums[first]
            last_num = nums[last]
            
            if first_num < last_num:
                return first_num
            
            middle = first + ((last - first) // 2)
            middle_num = nums[middle]
            
            if middle_num > last_num:
                first = middle + 1
            elif first_num > middle_num:
                last = middle
            else:
                last -= 1
        
        return nums[first]
            
        
        
            

        
```
