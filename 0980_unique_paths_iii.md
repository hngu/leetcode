### 980. Unique Paths III
Hard

On a 2-dimensional grid, there are 4 types of squares:

1 represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.
2 represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
0 represents empty squares we can walk over.
-1 represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.
Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We have the following four paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: [[0,1],[2,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.
``` 

**Constraints**
```
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 20
1 <= m * n <= 20
-1 <= grid[i][j] <= 2
There is exactly one starting cell and one ending cell.
```

### Solution:
- Python version is the latest version
- JS version is my original version
- For both versions, an optimization you can make is use a seen matrix and set it to True and then reset. Similar to Word Search II.

            Go through the grid and:
            - count empty spaces
            - find the starting square
            - find the ending square
            
            Then use recursion and DFS to find all paths that gets to the
            exit square. You have to brute force this. This will be exponential.

- Whenever we see the context of grid traversal, the technique of backtracking or DFS (Depth-First Search) should ring a bell. Maybe DP as well.
- Use backtracking!
- I messed up on kicking off the helper, miscounting the number of zeroes, passing `coord[i], coord[j]` into the helper function inside nextPaths forEach
- Also, return once you find 2.
- I also terminated too early: if there are no zeroes, doesn't mean a path [[1,2]] does not exist. The answer in that scenario is 1!
