### 221. Maximal Square
Medium

Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area. 

**Example 1:**
```
["1","0","1","0","0"]
["1","0","1","1","1"]
["1","1","1","1","1"]
["1","0","0","1","0"]

Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**
```
["0","1"]
["1","0"]

Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
```

### Solution

class Solution:

            DP problem
            copy the matrix as dp array and init with all zeroes
            for each cell in matrix:

            dp[i][j] = min(dp[left], dp[above], dp[diagonal]) + 1
            the plus one is for cells that are ones because if it is surrounded
            by zeroes, the square with the 1 still has area of 1.
