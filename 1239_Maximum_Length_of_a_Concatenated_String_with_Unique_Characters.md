### 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters
Medium

Given an array of strings arr. String s is a concatenation of a sub-sequence of arr which have unique characters.

Return the maximum possible length of s. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = ["un","iq","ue"]
Output: 4
Explanation: All possible concatenations are "","un","iq","ue","uniq" and "ique".
Maximum length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = ["cha","r","act","ers"]
Output: 6
Explanation: Possible solutions are "chaers" and "acters".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"]
Output: 26
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= arr.length <= 16
1 <= arr[i].length <= 26
arr[i] contains only lower case English letters.
```
