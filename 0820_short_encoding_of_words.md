### 820. Short Encoding of Words
Medium

A valid encoding of an array of words is any reference string s and array of indices indices such that:

words.length == indices.length
The reference string s ends with the '#' character.
For each index indices[i], the substring of s starting from indices[i] and up to (but not including) the next '#' character is equal to words[i].
Given an array of words, return the length of the shortest reference string s possible of any valid encoding of words. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
Output: 10
Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = "time#bell#" and indices = [0, 2, 5].
words[0] = "time", the substring of s starting from indices[0] = 0 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[1] = "me", the substring of s starting from indices[1] = 2 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
words[2] = "bell", the substring of s starting from indices[2] = 5 to the next '#' is underlined in "time#bell#"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["t"]
Output: 2
Explanation: A valid encoding would be s = "t#" and indices = [0].
```
 
**Constraints:**
```
1 <= words.length <= 2000
1 <= words[i].length <= 7
words[i] consists of only lowercase letters.
```

### Solution:
```
class Solution:
    def minimumLengthEncoding(self, words: List[str]) -> int:
        """
            The idea is to create a lookup of all the words
            and its suffixes. Then you can check if the word
            is in that lookup. If it is not, then it will
            be part of the answer.
        """
        # reverse the list of words to process
        # largest words first
        words.sort(key=lambda x: len(x), reverse=True)
        lookup = set()
        total = 0
        
        for word in words:
            if word in lookup:
                continue
                
            # it is unique so add a hash
            total += len(word) + 1
            
            # add suffixes to the set
            # include the full word as well
            for i in range(1, len(word) + 1):
                lookup.add(word[-i:])
        
        return total
        
```

### Trie Data Structure:
```
class Solution(object):
    def minimumLengthEncoding(self, words):
        words = list(set(words)) #remove duplicates
        #Trie is a nested dictionary with nodes created
        # when fetched entries are missing
        Trie = lambda: collections.defaultdict(Trie)
        trie = Trie()

        #reduce(..., S, trie) is trie[S[0]][S[1]][S[2]][...][S[S.length - 1]]
        nodes = [reduce(dict.__getitem__, word[::-1], trie)
                 for word in words]

        #Add word to the answer if it's node has no neighbors
        return sum(len(word) + 1
                   for i, word in enumerate(words)
                   if len(nodes[i]) == 0)
```
