### 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

There are some spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter, and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. The start is always smaller than the end.

An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps traveling up infinitely.

Given an array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend], return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: points = [[1,2]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: points = [[2,3],[2,3]]
Output: 1
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
0 <= points.length <= 104
points.length == 2
-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1
```

### Solution:
```
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMinArrowShots = function(points) {
    // sort the array by start points
    // have a merged interval array = []
    // for each point:
    // check if a point overlaps the last interval in merged
    // if it does, then merge them by taking the max of their starts and min of the ends
    // if not, push to merged interval
    // return merged interval array.length
    
    points = points.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[0] < b[0]) {
            return -1;
        }
        if (a[0] > b[0]) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (a[1] < b[1]) {
            return -1;
        }
        if (a[1] > b[1]) {
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    });
    
    const merged = [];
    
    points.forEach(point => {
        if (!merged.length) {
            merged.push(point);
            return;
        }

        const last = merged[merged.length - 1];
        if ((point[0] <= last[1] && last[1] <= point[1]) ||
           last[0] <= point[1] && point[1] <= last[1])  {
            merged.pop();
            merged.push([Math.max(point[0], last[0]), Math.min(point[1], last[1])]);
        } else {
            merged.push(point);
        }
    });
    
    return merged.length;
};
```
