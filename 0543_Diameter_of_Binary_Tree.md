### 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
Easy

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them. 

**Example 1:**
```
     1
  2     3
4   5

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

**Example 2:**
```
  1
2

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
```

            Then add it at the root to get the current root's diameter.
