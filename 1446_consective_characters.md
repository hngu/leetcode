### 1446. Consecutive Characters

Given a string s, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Return the power of the string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "triplepillooooow"
Output: 5
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: s = "hooraaaaaaaaaaay"
Output: 11
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: s = "tourist"
Output: 1
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= s.length <= 500
s contains only lowercase English letters.
```

### Solution:

```
class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 1
        max_count = count
        ptr = 1
        current_char = s[0]
        length = len(s)
        
        while ptr < length:
            next_char = s[ptr]
            if next_char == current_char:
                count += 1
                max_count = max(count, max_count)
            else:
                count = 1
                max_count = max(count, max_count)
                current_char = next_char
            
            ptr += 1
        
        return max_count
```
