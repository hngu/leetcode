### 827. Making A Large Island
Hard

You are given an n x n binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1.

Return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.

An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.
 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change one 0 to 1 and connect two 1s, then we get an island with area = 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Change the 0 to 1 and make the island bigger, only one island with area = 4.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Can't change any 0 to 1, only one island with area = 4.
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
n == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n <= 500
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
```

            Similar to finding all connected components in a graph
            - Use BFS for each 1s and mark them with a different island counter
            - Do this until all 1s are marked
            
            Find the max size of any connected component and set it currMax
            
            Then go through the matrix looking for zeroes and do the following:
            - check if there are any 1s in the left, right, above below me.
            - if there isn't skip
            - if there are, count the 1s and update currMax
