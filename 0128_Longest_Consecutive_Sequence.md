### 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Medium

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3
``` 

Constraints:
```
0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
```

### Solution
Naive solution:
- Sort the array
- Then find the LCS, ignoring dups

Optimal solution:
- Create a hashmap or hashset of nums
- Then for each num in the hash:
- Check if there is a num2 that is num + 1. Do this check until you can't find one. Then take the max of LCS and current LCS.
- You can also check if the current num is already in a sequence with num - 1 check in the hash. Then all you have to do is check if your current num is the start of a sequence.
```
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestConsecutive = function(nums) {
    let numMap = [];
    nums.forEach(num => numMap[num] = true);
    let lcs = 0;
    let current = 0;

    console.log(Object.keys(numMap));
    Object.keys(numMap).forEach(key => {
        if (numMap[key] === false) {
            return;
        }

        current = 1;
        nextNum = parseInt(key, 10) + 1;
        while (numMap[nextNum.toString()] !== undefined) {
            numMap[nextNum.toString()] = false;
            nextNum += 1;
            current += 1;
        }

        lcs = Math.max(lcs, current);
        current = 0;
    });

    return Math.max(lcs, current);
};
```
