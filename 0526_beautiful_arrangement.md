### 526. Beautiful Arrangement

Suppose you have n integers from 1 to n. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these n numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= n) in this array:

The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
Given an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:
Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).
Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).
The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:
Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).
Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= n <= 15
```

### Solution:
```
class Solution:
    def countArrangement(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
            Use backtracking and recursion: make copies as you go.
        """
        self.total = 0
        
        def helper(arr, leftovers):
            if len(leftovers) == 0:
                self.total += 1
                return
                
            nextPos = len(arr) + 1
            for index in range(len(leftovers)):
                num = leftovers[index]
                if num % nextPos is 0 or nextPos % num is 0:
                    clone = arr.copy()
                    clone.append(num)
                    helper(clone, leftovers[0:index] + leftovers[index+1:])
    
        
        helper([], list(range(1, n + 1)))
        return self.total
```
