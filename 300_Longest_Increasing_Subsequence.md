### 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence
Medium

Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].
 
**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= nums.length <= 2500
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
```

### Solution
- At first, I thought of using a 2D matrix that builds the LIS based on the previous cells
- But that is wrong because it will fail for [0,1,0,3,2,3]
- The idea is to assume that you have a lookup table that will tell you what is the Longest increasing subsequence ending at nums[i]
- Now let's say we add a new number at the end of nums, called j
- We compute the LIS ending at nums[j] checking all of nums[0...i] and see if it is less than nums[j]
- If it is, compute the subsequence
- Compute the longest over nums[i..j]
