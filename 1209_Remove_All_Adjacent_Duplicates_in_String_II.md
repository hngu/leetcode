## 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II
Medium

Given a string s, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.

It is guaranteed that the answer is unique. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
2 <= k <= 10^4
s only contains lower case English letters.
```
