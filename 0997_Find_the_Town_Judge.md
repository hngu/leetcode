### 997. Find the Town Judge
Easy

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= trust.length <= 104
trust[i].length == 2
All the pairs of trust are unique.
ai != bi
1 <= ai, bi <= n
```
