### 461. Hamming Distance
Easy

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
0 <= x, y <= (2^31) - 1
```

### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def hammingDistance(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        result = x ^ y
        count = 0
        
        while result != 0:
            count = count + (1 if result % 2 == 1 else 0)
            result //= 2
        
        return count
        
```
