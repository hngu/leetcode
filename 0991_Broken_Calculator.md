### 991. Broken Calculator
Medium

There is a broken calculator that has the integer startValue on its display initially. In one operation, you can:

multiply the number on display by 2, or
subtract 1 from the number on display.
Given two integers startValue and target, return the minimum number of operations needed to display target on the calculator.

 
**Example 1:**
```
Input: startValue = 2, target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Use double operation and then decrement operation {2 -> 4 -> 3}.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: startValue = 5, target = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: Use decrement and then double {5 -> 4 -> 8}.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: startValue = 3, target = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: Use double, decrement and double {3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10}.
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= x, y <= 10^9
```

### Solution
```
class Solution:
    def brokenCalc(self, startValue: int, target: int) -> int:
        """
            Work backwards to get target to startValue
            
            if the target is odd, you can't
            divide it so add one then divide
            
            once startValue >= target,
            then the rest of the operations
            are just add operations from startValue to target.

        ops = 0
        
        while startValue < target:
            if target % 2 == 1:
                target += 1
                target //= 2
                ops += 2
            else:
                target //= 2
                ops += 1
        
        return ops + (startValue - target)
