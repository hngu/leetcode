### 1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game
Easy

Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").
The first player A always places "X" characters, while the second player B always places "O" characters.
"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
No more moves can be played if the game is over.
Given an array moves where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which A and B play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that moves is valid (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and A will play first.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: "A" wins, he always plays first.
X 
  X
O O X
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: "B"
Explanation: "B" wins.
X X O
X O
O
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: "Draw"
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.
"XXO"

Output: "Pending"
Explanation: The game has not finished yet.
"X  "
" O "
"   "
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= moves.length <= 9
moves[i].length == 2
0 <= moves[i][j] <= 2
There are no repeated elements on moves.
moves follow the rules of tic tac toe.
```
