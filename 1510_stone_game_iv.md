### 1510. Stone Game IV

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are n stones in a pile.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer n. Return True if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return False, assuming both players play optimally.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: n = 7
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
If Alice starts removing 4 stones, Bob will remove 1 stone then Alice should remove only 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0). 
If Alice starts removing 1 stone, Bob will remove 4 stones then Alice only can remove 1 stone and finally Bob removes the last one (7 -> 6 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0).
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: n = 17
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can't win the game if Bob plays optimally.
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= n <= 10^5
```

### Solution:
```
class Solution:
    def winnerSquareGame(self, n: int) -> bool:
        """
            Use a bottom up approach: build a dp table
            with starting values: [False] * (n + 1)
            where dp[x] is whether the person going next will win with x stones
            
            To build this, we will iterate num from 1 to n:
                - get all squares for a num
                - subtract it from num
                - check if any result in a False for next move.
                - if it does, set it to True
                - otherwise, set it to False
            
            return dp[n]
        """
        def helper(n, dp):
            start = 1
            while start * start <= n:
                next = n - (start * start)
                if dp[next] == False:
                    dp[n] = True
                    break
                start += 1
    
        dp = [False] * (n + 1)
        start = 1
        while start <= n:
            helper(start, dp)
            start += 1
