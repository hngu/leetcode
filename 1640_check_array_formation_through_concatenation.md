### 1640. Check Array Formation Through Concatenation

You are given an array of distinct integers arr and an array of integer arrays pieces, where the integers in pieces are distinct. Your goal is to form arr by concatenating the arrays in pieces in any order. However, you are not allowed to reorder the integers in each array pieces[i].

Return true if it is possible to form the array arr from pieces. Otherwise, return false. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [85], pieces = [[85]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [15,88], pieces = [[88],[15]]
Output: true
Explanation: Concatenate [15] then [88]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = [49,18,16], pieces = [[16,18,49]]
Output: false
Explanation: Even though the numbers match, we cannot reorder pieces[0].
```

**Example 4:**
```
Input: arr = [91,4,64,78], pieces = [[78],[4,64],[91]]
Output: true
Explanation: Concatenate [91] then [4,64] then [78]
```

**Example 5:**
```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], pieces = [[2,4,6,8]]
Output: false
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= pieces.length <= arr.length <= 100
sum(pieces[i].length) == arr.length
1 <= pieces[i].length <= arr.length
1 <= arr[i], pieces[i][j] <= 100
The integers in arr are distinct.
The integers in pieces are distinct (i.e., If we flatten pieces in a 1D array, all the integers in this array are distinct).
```

### Solution:
- use a hashmap to store the location of a beginning piece -> the piece array (elements are distinct!)
- use a greedy approach and check if the arr element exists in pieces array
- remove the array element
- move on to the next element
```
class Solution:
    def canFormArray(self, arr: List[int], pieces: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        hashmap = {}
        for piece in pieces:
            hashmap[piece[0]] = piece
        
        while len(arr) > 0:
            num = arr[0]
            
            if num not in hashmap:
                return False
            
            piece = hashmap[num]
            
            count = 0
            while count < len(piece):
                if num != piece[count]:
                    return False
                arr.pop(0)
                num = arr[0] if len(arr) > 0 else None
                count += 1
        
        return True
        
```
