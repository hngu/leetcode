### 509. Fibonacci Number

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
```
F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
Given N, calculate F(N).
```
 
**Example 1:**
```
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: 3
Output: 2
Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
``` 

**Note:**
```
0 ≤ N ≤ 30.
```

### Solution:
- Bottom up: keep track of the first and second fibonacci numbers and build up to the final fibonacci number.

```
class Solution:
    def fib(self, N: int) -> int:
        first = 0
        second = 1
        ans = None
        
        if N == 0:
            return first
        if N == 1:
            return second
        
        start = 2
        while start <= N:
            ans = first + second
            first = second
            second = ans
            start += 1
        
        return ans
        
```
