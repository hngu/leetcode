### 42. Trapping Rain Water
Hard

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
n == height.length
0 <= n <= 3 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105
```

            For each num, get the max left wall and the max right wall

            subtract the current num from that wall
