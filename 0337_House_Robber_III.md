### 337. House Robber III
Medium

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called root.

Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police. 

**Example 1:**
```
   3
2     3
  3     1
 
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```
    3
  4     5
1   3     1

Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
0 <= Node.val <= 10^4
```

### Solution
- My solution uses recursion with DP memoization.
- There is a bottom up solution below this one.
