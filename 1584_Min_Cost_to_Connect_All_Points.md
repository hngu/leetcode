### 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points
Medium

You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].

The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.

Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points. 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
Output: 20
Explanation: 

We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
Output: 18
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= points.length <= 1000
-10^6 <= xi, yi <= 10^6
All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.
```
