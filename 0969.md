### 969. Pancake Sorting

Given an array of integers A, We need to sort the array performing a series of pancake flips.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:
```
Choose an integer k where 0 <= k < A.length.
Reverse the sub-array A[0...k].
For example, if A = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so A = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.
```
Return an array of the k-values of the pancake flips that should be performed in order to sort A. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * A.length flips will be judged as correct.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: A = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: A = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): A = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): A = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): A = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): A = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
Notice that we return an array of the chosen k values of the pancake flips.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: A = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
``` 

**Constraints:**
```
1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i] <= A.length
All integers in A are unique (i.e. A is a permutation of the integers from 1 to A.length).
```

### Solution:

Intuition: bubble up the largest number to the top!

```
/**
 * @param {number[]} A
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var pancakeSort = function(A) {
    let nextPosition = A.length - 1;
    let result = [];
    
    if (A.length <= 1) {
        return result;
    }
    
    while (nextPosition > 0) {
        let max = Math.max(...A.slice(0, nextPosition + 1));
        if (A[nextPosition] === max) {
            nextPosition -= 1;
            continue;
        }
        
        let maxIndex = A.indexOf(max);
        // we flip at the maxIndex so it is at the beginning
        result.push(maxIndex + 1);
        // do the pancake flip
        A = [...A.slice(0, maxIndex + 1).reverse(), ...A.slice(maxIndex + 1)];
        // flip at the nextPosition
        result.push(nextPosition + 1);
        A = [...A.slice(0, nextPosition + 1).reverse(), ...A.slice(nextPosition + 1)];
        nextPosition -= 1;
    }
    
    return result;
};
```
