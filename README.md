# leetcode

Strategies:
- Sliding Window
- Prefix Sum/Suffix Sum
- Interval Problems: use a stack and modify the last stack if overlap, otherwise add it stack.

Data Structures:
- Trie
- Heap
- Binary Index Tree (Fenwick Tree)
- Segment Tree

Python:
- use deque for lists: they have better performance
- SortedList: let's you find elements strictly greater than / less than x in O(log n) time using bisect_left or bisect_right.
